      - type: paragraph
        data: |
          Maria is a 73-year-old woman living in Pittsburgh, who recently lost her husband of 54 years to cancer. The loss was devastating, leaving Maria utterly heartbroken and overwhelmed by the uncertainty of her physical and financial future. While mostly independent, Maria faces her own health challenges, having been diagnosed with early onset Parkinson’s disease; she has trouble moving around, and requires assistance with daily tasks like loading the dishwasher, cooking, and sweeping the floors.

          Her daughter, Romana, is a 42-year-old nurse living in another state with her own family. Despite her strong desire to help and knowledge that her mother’s physical condition will worsen, Romana feels overwhelmed and unsure how to support her mother.

      - type: paragraph
        data: |
          In collaboration with the Experience Design team at PNC, I led multiple research efforts to understand the current landscape of financial planning and aging, culminating in the design and development of a new product, RetireReady.

    data:
      - type: sub-header
        data: |
          Assisted daily living services (ADLS) include a range of support provided to individuals needing assistance with daily activities due to age, disability, or health issues. These services encompass tasks such as bathing, dressing, meal preparation, medication administration, housekeeping, transportation, and companionship.

  - title: User Interviews
    data:
      - type: header
        data: |
          I conducted 20 interviews with key stakeholders and discovered a widespread lack of preparedness, limited knowledge, and psychological / cultural barriers that significantly hinder financial planning for aging.

      - type: paragraph
        data: |
          Given the broad scope of the project and various stakeholders involved, we initially did not define a specific problem statement. To evaluate the current state of post-retirement planning and the costs associated with aging, I crafted an interview guide, adopted a directed storytelling approach, and conducted 1-hour long sessions with over 20 individuals, including aging parents (55+), adult children (25-55), caregivers, and financial advisors.

      - type: paragraph
        data: |
          During our interviews, Maria and Romana provided valuable insights into their experiences. Maria shared her fears about her financial future and her health, while Romana expressed her challenges in balancing her career, family, and supporting her mother. These conversations highlighted the emotional and logistical complexities faced by families in similar situations.

        data: |
          To explore the potential market for a collaborative financial planning tool, we deployed three surveys targeting aging parents and adult children (split into two age brackets). I led the development of these surveys, focusing on questions probing sentiments related to planning for financial, medical, and ADLS expenses and collaboration with trusted individuals.

      - type: paragraph
        data: |
          Maria and Romana's responses were particularly insightful. Maria expressed a desire for a tool that could simplify her financial planning and involve her daughter in the process. Romana emphasized the need for clear, accessible information and resources to help her support her mother effectively.

          I led 2 ideation sessions, wherein we brainstormed a number of different ideas like multiple permissions on a shared financial dashboard, educational resources on planning for ADLS, and an AI-powered budgeting tool, etc.

      - type: paragraph
        data: |
          Maria and Romana's needs were central to our ideation process. We envisioned features that would allow Romana to help manage Maria's finances remotely, provide educational resources to both of them, and use AI to predict future expenses based on Maria's health and lifestyle.

      - type: paragraph
        data: |
          We had all these disparate ideas, but we didn’t have a clear idea about which direction to move in and which solutions actually served our customer needs. We subsequently decided to map out a solution matrix and check off what specific segment needs were being met.

      - type: paragraph
        data: |
          Here, we made the crucial decision to tease apart our aging parents into a pre-retirees segment from the ages of 50 - 65, because our customer interviews and survey insights had revealed that lifestyles change very significantly pre-retirement and post-retirement, and needs change accordingly.

                  User interviews and surveys revealed that users were drawn to the concept of a “centralized repository” of important financial, legal, and medical documentation.
                  Accordingly, we visualized the PNC portal as a hub, wherein all information can be stored and shared with trusted individuals.

          With deadlines fast approaching, we parallelly developed a robust product strategy for RetireReady. This involved creating a business model canvas, which included estimation of costs, revenue, market size, key partners, and potential risks in the first year of development and launch.

          Finally, with both a conceptual framework of the product strategy and a concrete vision for the product itself, we forwarded our recommendation to the PNC Experience Design team:

      - type: paragraph
        data: |
          RetireReady is a tool that is meant to facilitate financial planning. The main differentiator between RetireReady and competitors is the healthcare considerations that are integrated into the AI calculation of expected expenses and personalized recommendations. While the tool is FREE for end users, the primary means of revenue for PNC is through these recommendations. Specifically, PNC will generate incremental revenue by promoting its own products (PNC Advisory Services and PNC Investments) as well as commissions from partner companies (e.g., ADLS service providers, meal services, etc.).

          PNC will work over the next couple of years to test and integrate RetireReady with another similar technology that they have recently developed, Smart Fam.
