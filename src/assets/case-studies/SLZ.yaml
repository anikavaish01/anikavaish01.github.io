      - type: paragraph
        data: |
          Smart Loading Zones (SLZs) are a government-sponsored initiative meant to provide delivery drivers with safe curb space, reduce traffic congestion, and lower emissions from idling cars in Pittsburgh, PA.

      - type: header
        data: |
          With a soft launch in mid-2023, SLZs have been met with largely negative and critical reception from native Pittsburghers.

      - type: sub-header
        data: Meet Vishal.

      - type: paragraph
        data: |
          Vishal is a 34 year-old marketing manager at a medium-size startup in Pittsburgh, PA. He’s been a long-time resident of the city, completing both his Bachelor’s and Master’s degree at the University of Pittsburgh. In 2012, Vishal sadly met with a car accident that left him moderately paralyzed from the waist down. Despite his circumstances, Vishal is labeled by his doctors as “high-functioning,” which means that he is able to move about his day quite independently: he drives, shops, exercises, and works without any additional assistance aside from his super dope wheelchair wheels.

        data: |
          Recently, Vishal has noticed some purple curbs near some of his favorite eateries and the local shops he frequents. They have a sign nearby that tell him that these are “Smart Loading Zones,” that a person needs to register before using them, and that they utilize graduated pay-by-minute parking... WHAT!?

      - type: paragraph
        data: |
          He has no idea what these are and assumes that he can’t use the spots anymore. Now, Vishal is extremely frustrated that he needs to park nearly a block away and struggle to wheel-up the broken Pittsburgh sidewalks to pick up dinner. He’s desperately missing the days of storefront parking.

          But Vishal is not alone. Despite their goal to serve all Pittsburgh residents, our team found a major gap: disabled drivers are not part of the conversation at all.

          How might we make SLZs more accessible and equitable for drivers with disabilities, expanding their benefits to more community members?

    title: Wait, but how do SLZ's work?
    colored: true
    data:
      - type: sub-header
        data: |
          Designated by purple curbs, SLZs employ innovative camera technology to read license plates and analyze real-time curbside activity, automating payment for the time a vehicle spends at a purple curb. Registered users are billed by the minute for the exact time spent in the zone. Registration is a one-time process, wherein users access an online web application by scanning a QR-code on the sign.

  - title: Secondary Research
    data:
      - type: header
        data: |
          I conducted comprehensive desk research and discovered a growing confusion and unease surrounding the SLZ initiative.

      - type: paragraph
        data: |
          Referencing press releases issued by the city government, the official SLZ pamphlet put forth by the Pittsburgh parking authority, and other newspaper and social media material, I investigated both the nitty-gritty specifics of the program infrastructure as well as the general public’s sentiment towards it.

      - type: paragraph
        data: |
          These materials served to expose the government’s half-baked plan; specifically, I came across 20+ Reddit threads with unanswered civilian questions, critical (bordering on caustic) articles from local news outlets, no definite payment structure or enforcement specification, and most problematic -- a severe lack of clarity surrounding rules and regulations.

        data: |
          After a grueling round of hide-and-seek, I concluded that there is no easily discoverable policy or measure that accommodates people like Vishal, either time-wise or monetarily, when using SLZs. This could be due to a lack of clarity or a direct violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act.

  - title: Ethnographic research
    data:
      - type: header
        data: |
          To better empathize with users, I engaged in experiential research, bodystorming the process of parking and registering at an SLZ. I observed massive downtimes and critical issues with the web application.

        data: |
          Just like Vishal, people avoid parking along purple curbsides. This breeds inefficiency because the designated zone is underutilized during downtimes. This also poses economic challenges for storefronts, as previously utilized customer parking spots go vacant, reducing potential transactions and profits.

  - title: Heuristic Evaluation
    data:
      - type: header
        data: |
          From the physical signage to the web application, I experienced a great deal of friction. Specifically, there were gaps in the information made available to users, confusing verbiage, and inconsistencies in policy.

      - type: paragraph
        data: |
          Because the Pittsburgh Parking Authority is launching a MVP, the user flow of the registration process is largely untested. Accordingly, my team and I saw the value in individually carrying out a heuristic evaluation of the interface. We then collapsed our individual findings, and prioritized the main violations that most critically impacted usability.

          The web application violates several of Jakob Nielsen’s heuristics, with the primary usability issues revolving around "help and documentation" and "match between system and the real world." Specifically, there is a lack of resources and poorly defined payment and parking metrics.

  - title: User Interviews
    data:
      - type: header
        data: |
          Reaching out to a vulnerable population is always tricky. Through multiple recruitment mediums, my team and I were able to speak to 5 disabled drivers. These drivers conveyed a limited knowledge, general distrust, and severe frustration/ concern with SLZs.

      - type: paragraph
        data: |
          Up until this point, my preliminary research hadn’t surfaced any specific sentiments regarding accessibility. To learn more about the disabled driver experience, we subsequently carried out 5 interviews with disabled drivers, operationalizing “disability” as individuals with permanent disabilities, temporary physical disabilities, and of older age (65+).

      - type: paragraph
        data: |
          The objectives of the interviews were twofold. Firstly, we aimed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the accessibility of the SLZs, how individuals with various types of disabilities engage with them, and the specific situations in which they make use of these zones. Secondly, we sought to identify the challenges and difficulties encountered by these individuals, while also comparing their experiences with those in other parking zones across the city. I drafted the following testing and analysis plan.

              - type: paragraph
                data: |
                  - The signage does not explicitly indicate whether the parking spot is an accessible spot.
                  - Signs are placed at a height that can be difficult for people in wheelchairs or with limited arm mobility to reach to scan the QR-code registration.
                  - Individuals with colorblindness have difficulty distinguishing the purple curbs from any other curb.

                  SLZs effectively eliminate prime parking spaces for drivers with disabilities and reduce the number of potential customers for small businesses.

              - type: paragraph
                data: |
                  - Due to their proximity to storefronts, SLZs could improve accessibility for those needing to minimize walking distance to their destinations (our very own Vishal).
                  - Local business owners believe that SLZs actually reduce opportunities for disabled customers to serve as patrons.

                data: |
                  - The pay-by-minute parking and no existing policy to afford payment leniency unfairly target those with disabilities who generally take longer to unload.
                  - Disabled drivers (an often already financially strained population) may unnecessarily harm themselves while trying to minimize cost.

          Speed dating revealed that users preferred solutions that offered payment leniency, automatically adjusted rates based on disability status, utilized familiar payment methods, and offered more context and information about how to use SLZs. Accordingly, we proposed the following 3 design solutions:

          We presented our final recommendation to folks at the City of Pittsburgh Parking Authority. Specifically, to streamline the experience of users with disabilities, we proposed  integrating a short user flow that occurs at the end of the registration process and allows drivers with disabilities the opportunity to apply for financial and time accommodations by scanning or inputting their handicap placard identification number into the system.

          If approved, this feature automatically applies a reduced rate for users with disabilities, reducing the urge to rush and potentially harm an already vulnerable body.

          Our proposed solution is extremely practical due to its necessity and urgency. We recommend leveraging existing accommodative systems like handicap placards to improve accessibility rather than introducing something new. In such a way, we aim to optimize ease of implementation, while greatly improving accessibility for SLZ users.
