            Smart Loading Zones (SLZs) are a recent city-wide initiative meant to allow delivery drivers safe use of
            curb
            space for loading, limit traffic congestion, and reduce carbon emissions produced by idling cars in
            Pittsburgh,
            PA.
            

            With a soft launch in mid-2023, SLZs have been met with largely negative and critical reception from native
            Pittsburghers. Over several months, our team was challenged to evaluate the current state, understand user
            pain
            points, identify high-priority areas of improvement, and propose solutions to better the overall user
            experience
            of SLZs.

              Designated by purple curbs, SLZs employ innovative camera technology to read license plates and analyze
              real-time curbside activity, automating payment for the time a vehicle spends at a purple curb. Registered
              users are billed by the minute for the exact time spent in the zone. Registration is a one-time process,
              wherein users access an online web application by scanning a QR-code on the sign.

    data:
      - type: paragraph
        data: Our team utilized abstraction laddering to define the problem space. By analyzing various components of SLZs at various levels of abstraction from the concrete “how” to the abstract “why,” we realized that a number of our concerns centered around accessibility.

            data: Parking is a key factor contributing to community and economic engagement, particularly with local businesses. As we consider solutions to issues with parking and loading, inclusiveness is critical. Accessibility should be at the forefront of this initiative, not an afterthought.

      - type: paragraph
        data: Referencing press releases issued by the city government, the official SLZ pamphlet put forth by the Pittsburgh parking authority, and other newspaper and social media material, I conducted comprehensive white paper research. I was particularly interested in investigating both the nitty-gritty specifics of the program infrastructure as well as the general public’s sentiment towards it. My research served to highlight the growing confusion and unease surrounding the entire initiative.

                data: There exists no policy or measure that accommodates people with disabilities time-wise or monetarily when using SLZs. Either this is an issue of lack of clarity or this is a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act.

      - type: paragraph
        data: While white paper research served to solidify my understanding of the problem, I wanted to better empathize with users. I consequently engaged in some experiential research, where I first bodystormed through the process of parking in an SLZ and registering for the program myself. I subsequently conducted ethnographic research, spending time observing zones in multiple locations and people’s interactions with them.

              - type: emphasis
                data: People avoid parking along purple curbsides, and only utilize them when there is absolutely no other available space. This breeds inefficiency because the designated zone is underutilized during downtimes.
