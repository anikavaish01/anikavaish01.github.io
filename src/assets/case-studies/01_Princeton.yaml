      - type: paragraph
        data: |
          With the rise of open science and the adoption of FAIR principles—guidelines designed to make data easier to find, access, and reuse — the scientific community is shifting towards more transparent and collaborative research practices. Research data management lies at the heart of this systemic shift.

      - type: paragraph
        data: |
          Research data management is the process of providing proper labeling, storage, and access to data at every stage of a research project.

        data: Meet Catelyn.

      - type: paragraph
        data: |
          Catelyn is a faculty advisor at Princeton University overseeing 8 PhD students and 15 research assistants in her chemistry lab. Across all her students, Catelyn is a supervisor on 20+ projects going on in the lab. Moreover, as an educator, Catelyn also has the burden of preparing lectures and course material on top of applying for grants and funding. Catelyn is very busy and simply does not have the time to ensure that all the data in her lab is appropriately labeled and organized.

  - title: What is TigerData?
    colored: true
    data:
      - type: paragraph
        data: |
          Researchers at Princeton like Catelyn currently access institutional data resources via a command-line interface that connects them through servers. While this system is powerful, it requires memorizing hundreds of commands, making it intimidating for those not deeply familiar with it. Many researchers find this complexity adds to their workload, hindering efficient data management.

      - type: header
        data: |
          TigerData aims to simplify the process of accessing and organizing data by replacing the command line with an easily accessible front-end. Let’s design it!

        data: |
          To gain a comprehensive understanding of landscape of research data management, we conducted a thorough analysis of research papers, articles, websites, memos, conference papers, and government reports. We explored four key verticals: data storage, data organization for sharing, regulatory compliance, and adoption.

        data: |
          I analyzed summaries of different materials from each of my colleagues, and drew out the most notable insights.

                  Large universities suffer from poor social interoperability, or the inability of faculty, researchers, administrators, and staff to work together efficiently, share knowledge, and coordinate efforts to achieve common goals.

              - type: paragraph
                data: |
                  - In a survey of 300 researchers, one respondent described encountering “six or seven research profiling systems to aid in research discovery.” Not only is this a duplication of time, cost, and effort, it also speaks to the “failure of multiple stakeholders to work together on a unified system.”

                  Decentralized data management practices, characterized by fragmented workflows and diverse toolsets, lead to inefficiencies and difficulties in data sharing.

              - type: paragraph
                data: |
                  - In a cost-benefit analysis commissioned by the European Union, financial experts determined that decentralized research processes and a lack of FAIR principles cost the European economy a conservative estimate of €10.2 billion every year. 
                  - Approximately 31.52% of time spent finding data could be saved with an appropriate application of FAIR principles in the use and quality of metadata.
                  - Experts suggest that implementing FAIR principles will reduce the number of redundant copies of data by 20%.

          Extrapolating from our literature review and a unviersity-wide data growth curve of 30%, I estimated that current (unsustainable) data practices would increase the university’s operational costs by $50M in the year 2046 alone.

  - title: Heuristic evaluation
    data:
      - type: paragraph
        data: |
          Our literature review validated that DM best practices are of utmost importance for operational efficiency. In conversations with the TigerData team, we were made aware that there already exist tools that are meant to aid in these processes. We did a deep dive into the most commonly used tool, the Open Science Framework (OSF), because of its alignment with TigerData’s mission statement. Our analysis included assessing OSF’s features, usability, and integration within academic and research communities.

      - type: spacer

      - type: sub-header
        data: |
          Not only is OSF unable to handle the demands of researchers like Catelyn who work with large datasets, but there is a considerable learning curve to OSF, which can further demoralize researchers who may have lesser technical knowledge. Moreover, the system lacks flexibility, which raises concern as each research field is highly specialized and necessitates specific, individualized treatments.

          Moreover, drawing from both positive heuristics and identified violations, we developed a conceptual framework for an effective data management tool. This framework emphasized attributes such as familiarity (e.g., integrating familiar tool add-ons), learnability (e.g., easy access to support and tutorials), and discoverability (e.g., prioritizing recognition over recall).

        data: |
          We conducted semi-structured interviews with 4 CMU librarians from the Research Data Services team and with 10+ researchers from both CMU and Princeton. These interviews provided insights into the support offered by librarians, the challenges researchers face with data management, and the motivations behind adopting new tools.

                  Drawing from repeated exposure theory, we made researchers aware of their storage usage at multiple points within the system. We also provided a calculator to better estimate storage needs. 
                  Additionally, we introduced a friction point: researchers requesting more than 100TB of storage must complete an additional form. In doing so, we discouraged researchers from defaulting to asking for the maximum amount of storage, and urged greater mindfulness surrounding storage requests.

                  We can leverage integrations with existing repositories and resources to foster a culture of data sharing, collaboration, and data recycling. Moreover, by incorporating a familiar system that is already well-situated within the Princeton research ecosystem, researchers are more likely to be comfortable sharing sample datasets and other data; “I’d definitely share my data if I could have control over who was using it.”

                data: 78% of researchers would leverage TigerData to find and share unpublished, active research data. This is expected to reduce potential university data rot by 90%.

                  To encourage data reuse, we recommend that TigerData expand to allow the sharing of unpublished, active research data. 
                  100% of users were concerned with data security; accordingly, we implemented a series of safeguards to address potential sensitivities. That is, researchers can set permissions on data. If access is restricted, researchers seeking the data must submit a screening questionnaire created by the project owner. Access to project contents is granted only upon approval, ensuring controlled and secure data sharing.
