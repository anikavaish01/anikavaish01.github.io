          A puzzle and word-game enthusiast, I’m a critical thinker, a problem-solver, a team player. And yes, I’m always up for a round of Wordle.

          I’m Anika, and while I am officially a UX Researcher, I prefer to think of myself as a life-long learner. I recently earned my Master’s Degree in Human-Computer Interaction from Carnegie Mellon University, where I spent 8 months collaborating on a client project with Princeton University’s Research Computing Services team to curate the front-end of a research data management tool. I also had the opportunity to work alongside the PNC Experience Design Team to design for complex financial and familial interactions, as well as UPMC physicians / data scientists to create an accessible ML data modeling platform. Prior to my time at CMU, I worked as a researcher at UCLA for 2 years, probing the underpinnings of Parkinson’s disease in the Bitan Lab and exploring the subtleties of human perception in the Computational Vision and Learning Lab.

          All these experiences in concert have served to solidify my passion for research, data, and piecing puzzles together. Now, as I venture into industry, I am excited to put my technical background in cognitive psychology, programming, and academic research to use in real-world applications. But more than that, I am eager to understand humans better, and center their thoughts, feelings, and stories in digital design.

          Storytelling is my passion, data is my guiding pillar, words are my medium, and people are at the heart of everything I do.

          It’s a tie! I love the nuance and thoughtfulness required to write the most perfect survey question (it’s truly an art), but I also find nothing more thrilling than collaborating with end-users face-to-face in a fruitful co-design session.
